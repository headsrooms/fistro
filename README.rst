Fistro
======

A fixture generator based on type annotations.

Installation
------------

>>> pip install poetry
>>> poetry install -v

If you were on a virtualenv, dependencies will be installed on this one,
otherwise a new virtualenv will be created and poetry will show you the path.

Another way is with:

>>> pip install -r requirements.txt

This way dev dependencies won't be installed.
