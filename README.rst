# fistro

A fixture generator based on type annotations.

## Installation

```
pip install poetry
poetry install -v
```
If you were on a virtualenv, dependencies will be installed on this one,
otherwise a new virtualenv will be created and poetry will show you the path.

Another way is with:
 ```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
This way dev dependencies won't be installed.


## Usage
TODO

## Tests

```
pytest
```
